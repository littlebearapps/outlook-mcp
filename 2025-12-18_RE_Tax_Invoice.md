Dear Nathan,

 

We refer to your email disputing Invoice #31731 dated 21 November 2025 and alleging breaches of the Australian Consumer Law (ACL), the Tax Agent Services Act 2009 (TASA), and associated professional standards.

 

We do not accept your characterisation of events, the legal conclusions you have drawn, or your demand that the invoice be withdrawn. Your correspondence omits material contractual facts, relies on selective excerpts, and is inconsistent with your own written instructions and admissions throughout the engagement.

 

For clarity and completeness, we respond below to each of your allegations with reference to the engagement letter you signed, contemporaneous emails, dates, and independent third-party confirmation.

 

Preliminary matter: engagement letter and fee disclosure

You executed our engagement letter in February 2025, which governs the scope of services, responsibilities, timing, and billing basis for this engagement.

That engagement letter provides, in substance, that:

Client responsibility for information: You are responsible for providing complete, accurate, and timely information, and we are entitled to rely on the information you provide without independent verification unless otherwise agreed.Timing dependent on client cooperation: Our ability to complete and lodge work is dependent on you providing required information within reasonable timeframes. Delays caused by incomplete, late, or unavailable information are not delays attributable to us.Drafts vs lodgement: Tax returns are prepared in draft form and are only lodged after client review, confirmation, and authority to lodge. We are not required — and are not permitted — to lodge returns that are incomplete, disputed, or unsupported.Fees payable for work performed: Fees are payable for work undertaken and time incurred in accordance with the engagement, irrespective of whether returns are ultimately lodged, where work has been performed.In addition, our fee structure was provided to you upon request on 9 September 2025, including our bookkeeping rate of $70 per hour. You did not raise any objection to the disclosed rates or the basis on which work would be charged.

These contractual terms and disclosures are directly relevant to your allegations under ACL ss.18, 60–62 and to any assessment under TASA s.30-10.

 

1. Allegation: “No lodged returns after 12 months” – ACL s.62

You assert that following a 12-month engagement no returns were lodged and that this is not a “reasonable time” under ACL s.62.

This allegation is misleading because it ignores:

when usable information was actually provided;your own written admissions regarding delay and incapacity;the absence of complete information and authority to lodge; andour professional obligation not to lodge incomplete or disputed returns. 

(a) Client-caused delay and lack of usable information

On 12 May 2025, you wrote:

“It’s taken me more than six months since our November/December 2024 call to provide you with any information at all.”
“I’m now completely stuck after months of trying to push through.”
“The primary blocker right now is data access from Bank Australia.”

This is a clear admission that usable information was not available for a substantial portion of the engagement period.

On 12 June 2025, you advised that transaction data had only then been converted from PDF statements into CSV format and provided to us. Until that point, the information was not practically usable for reconciliation or summarisation.

 

(b) Expansion of scope at your request

In the same 12 May 2025 email, you requested a materially expanded scope of work:

“I need to ask that you take over the process from here as a full-service (or near full-service) engagement… I’m happy to pay a higher fee for the additional work.”

This resulted in substantial additional summarisation and reconstruction work.

On 8 August 2025, we advised you in writing:

“We have spent around 35 hours of our time summarising your documents for the financial years 2022, 2023 and 2024.”

You replied the same day:

“Holy moly, 35 hours! Thank you, Amanda.”

You did not object to the work undertaken, the time incurred, or the need for it.

 

(c) Completion status and lodgement

The tax returns were completed to draft stage. The fact that the returns were not lodged does not mean the work was not done.

The individual income tax returns and associated rental property schedules are complete and can be supplied to you. These documents are capable of being used for lodgement once the unresolved income attribution issues are addressed and authority to lodge is provided.

The returns were not lodged because:

material income components (alleged trust and distribution income) remained unresolved;your instructions regarding those income sources were contradictory; andyou did not approve the returns for lodgement, stating they were incorrect due to income not included — income you were unable to identify or quantify. 

As registered tax practitioners, we are prohibited under TASA s.30-10 from lodging returns that are incomplete, disputed, or unsupported by adequate information.

 

Consistent with the engagement letter and standard professional practice, fees are payable for work properly performed irrespective of whether lodgement ultimately occurs, particularly where non-lodgement results from unresolved client-side issues and lack of approval to lodge.

 

2. Allegation: “Defective work product” and failure to verify income

You allege that draft returns were “defective” and that our ongoing queries regarding ABN or trust-related income demonstrate incompetence.

This allegation cannot be sustained when your written instructions are examined chronologically.

 

(a) Your initial instructions – 27 January 2025

On, you wrote:

“I’ve attached a spreadsheet for FY23 and FY24 outlining the lump sum payments I received as a beneficiary of the Empresio Trust, along with details of my shareholdings in Empresio Capital.”

You further identified Imron Investments Pty Ltd and Little Bear Family Trust as relevant entities.

 

(b) Your clarification – 13 May 2025

On 13 May 2025, you wrote:

“I wasn’t the trustee or a major shareholder of either the Empresio Trust or Empresio Capital, so I don’t have access to their tax returns.”
“I’ve reached out to Stuart (the accountant for those entities) to request a breakdown of the lump sum payments made to me in each FY.”

You acknowledged that distribution income was asserted to exist but could not be quantified by you.

 

(c) Re-assertion – 11 August 2025

On 11 August 2025, you again wrote:

“The only other income earned would have been from Empresio (beneficiary payments and distributions).”

 

(d) Independent confirmation

At your in-person appointment on 14 October 2025, and consistent with your emails, we contacted your former accountant.

On 27 October 2025, we received an ethical letter confirming:

“The clients The Trustee for the Empresio Trust and Empresio Capital Pty Ltd do not relate to Nathan Schram.”

 

(e) Conclusion on “defective work”

Where a client repeatedly asserts income sources, cannot quantify them, and independent confirmation later establishes those entities do not relate to the client, it is not negligent or defective to raise queries, identify gaps, and refrain from lodgement. It is the only professionally competent course.

The documents you refer to were draft returns, prepared pending resolution of these contradictions in accordance with the engagement letter.

 

3. Allegation: invoice inconsistency and misleading conduct – ACL s.18

You allege misleading conduct under ACL s.18.

This allegation mischaracterises both the email and the invoice.

 

(a) What we told you

In our email accompanying the invoice, we stated:

“For the summarisation of your accounts, our bookkeeper spent 25.5 hours at a rate of $70 per hour. However, in good faith, we have applied a discount.”
“We have not charged for the additional summarisation completed by our other accountants; the fee reflects only the bookkeeper’s time to cover our costs.”

 

To be clear, you are being charged for the work of our accountants. What you are not being charged for is the additional summarisation time our accountants spent summarising your file; just our bookkeeper’s.

 

This was a gesture of goodwill, not an act to mislead you with our fees.

 

(b) What the invoice shows

Invoice #31731 records:

Summarisation of accounts: $1,785.00Discount: ($500.00)$1,785.00 equals exactly 25.5 hours × $70 per hour.

 

(c) Clarification

For the avoidance of doubt:

more than 35 hours were spent summarising your accounts;only 25.5 hours were charged for summarisation;no accountant time spent on additional summarisation or review was charged; anda $500 goodwill discount was applied. 

You requested the work to be undertaken, requested our fee structure, acknowledged the time spent, and did not instruct us to cease work. In those circumstances, your current demand for a full remission of fees for work you requested and which has been completed is inconsistent with both your prior instructions and the engagement terms.

 

There is no inconsistency or misrepresentation capable of amounting to misleading conduct under ACL s.18.

 

4. Deliverables, documents, and disengagement

For completeness and clarity:

The individual income tax returns and associated rental property schedules have been completed to draft stage.The fact that the returns were not lodged does not mean the work was not performed; lodgement was not possible due to unresolved income attribution issues and lack of approval to lodge.The draft returns and associated summaries prepared by us constitute professional work product and will be supplied to you upon payment of the outstanding invoice.All client-provided documents in our possession will be returned to you promptly and are not subject to lien. 

5. Closing position

We reject the suggestion that our conduct was improper, negligent, misleading, or otherwise in breach of our professional or statutory obligations. At all times, we acted in accordance with the Tax Agent Services Act 2009, the Code of Professional Conduct, and the engagement terms you accepted.

Should you wish to pursue this matter further, please note that we will defend our position vehemently, relying on the contemporaneous documentary record, including your own written instructions and the independent confirmation obtained from your former accountant.

 

Without prejudice, and purely in an effort to resolve this matter, we are prepared to offer a further goodwill discount of $500, bringing the total discount to $1,000, provided this arrangement is accepted by close of business Friday. Upon receipt of payment under this arrangement, we will supply the draft tax returns and associated work product you have requested.

 

Please note that our office will be closed from 19 December for the Christmas period. If this offer is not accepted by close of business Friday, we will proceed to pursue recovery of the outstanding amount in full, in accordance with our trading terms, without further concession.

 

We trust this clarifies our position.

Subject: Re: Tax Invoice

 

Dear Amanda & Elizabeth,

 

I am writing to formally dispute Invoice #31731 dated 21 November 2025 for $4,262.50 (including GST). Payment is withheld pending resolution of this dispute.

 

Three Core Issues

 

1. No Lodged Returns After 12 Months

 

After a 12-month engagement (November 2024 - November 2025), zero tax returns have been lodged with the ATO. I have received no final work product. Under the Australian Consumer Law s.62, services must be supplied within a reasonable time. Twelve months to produce four individual returns and associated schedules, with none lodged, is not reasonable.

 

2. Defective Work Product

 

The engagement produced draft returns containing fundamental errors. On 30 September 2025, I clarified that my sole trader ABN (32 380 848 852) was not activated until January 2025 and that I held no personal ABN in FY22-FY24. Despite this, queries about ABN income for those years persisted, indicating a failure to verify basic client information before attributing income.

 

This represents a competence failure under TASA 2009 s.30-10(9) - the duty to take reasonable care in ascertaining a client's state of affairs. Verifying ABN registration dates via the public Australian Business Register is fundamental due diligence and takes seconds to perform.

 

The work product is defective and will require my new accountant to prepare returns from scratch.

 

3. Invoice Contradicts Your Email

 

Your email of 21 November 2025 states the invoice reflects "only the bookkeeper's time to cover our costs" and that "we have not charged for the additional summarisation completed by our other accountants."

 

However, the invoice charges:

 

- Individual Tax Returns (4 x $310): $1,240

- Rental Property Schedules (8 x $150): $1,200

- Capital Gains Schedule: $150

- Subtotal (professional fees, not bookkeeper time): $2,590

 

Additionally, my disengagement email of 18 November 2025 specifically requested an itemised work-in-progress breakdown showing tasks performed, dates, and hours. Instead, I received this invoice with no such breakdown - only a total of 25.5 bookkeeper hours with no detail of what work was performed or when.

 

This is inconsistent with your stated basis for the invoice. The discrepancy between your email representation and the invoice amounts may constitute misleading conduct under Australian Consumer Law s.18.

 

Legal Framework

 

I note that tax agent services are regulated under the Tax Agent Services Act 2009 (Cth), specifically the Code of Professional Conduct at section 30-10. Professional accounting services are also subject to consumer guarantees under the Australian Consumer Law:

 

- Section 18: Prohibition on misleading or deceptive conduct

- Section 60: Services must be rendered with due care and skill

- Section 61: Services must be reasonably fit for the disclosed purpose

- Section 62: Services must be supplied within a reasonable time

 

I am also aware that Amanda Di Noto holds FIPA status with the Institute of Public Accountants and is therefore bound by APES 110 Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants.

 

What I Require

 

1. Withdrawal of Invoice #31731 in full

2. Copies of all work product - summarisation work papers, reconciliations, and any draft materials

3. Return of all client documents - bank statements, trust deed, ASIC statements (per TPB(I) 02/2011, client-provided documents are not subject to lien)

4. Written confirmation of disengagement

 

Reservation of Rights

 

I reserve the right to pursue all available remedies should this matter not be resolved satisfactorily, including:

 

- Tax Practitioners Board complaint (TASA s.30-10)

- Institute of Public Accountants complaint (APES 110)

- VCAT application (Australian Consumer Law s.18, s.60-62)

 

I am raising this dispute directly with you first in the hope of resolving it without the need for regulatory or tribunal proceedings.

 

Response Deadline

 

Please respond in writing by 31 December 2025, confirming:

 

1. Withdrawal of the invoice, or

2. Your substantive response to the three issues above, including:

   - How many returns were lodged with the ATO

   - Copies of all deliverables and work product

   - Reconciliation of the invoice/email discrepancy

 

If I do not receive a substantive response by this deadline, I will proceed with regulatory referrals.

 

Kind regards,

Nathan Schram

Hi Nathan,

As requested, please find attached your tax invoice for services rendered to date.

For the summarisation of your accounts, our bookkeeper spent 25.5 hours at a rate of $70 per hour. However, in good faith, we have applied a discount. We have not charged for the additional summarisation completed by our other accountants; the fee reflects only the bookkeeper’s time to cover our costs.

Despite the complexity of your file and the significant time invested, we have charged you at our lowest applicable rate.

Additionally, as per your request, we have removed ourselves as your tax agent for all nominated structures.

We wish you all the best in your future endeavours.

Have a Merry Christmas and a prosperous New Year.

 

Kind Regards,

 

Elizabeth Agresta
