# Publish to npm
#
# Publishes the package to npm when a version tag is pushed.
# Uses NPM_TOKEN (GitHub Actions secret) for authentication.
#
# Prerequisites:
# 1. Set NPM_TOKEN as a GitHub Actions secret (granular access token from npmjs.com)
#
# Usage:
#   npm version patch  # or minor/major
#   git push origin main --tags
#
# Future: migrate to OIDC trusted publishing when npmjs.com trusted publisher
# is configured (org=littlebearapps, repo=outlook-mcp, workflow=publish.yml)
# and Node 24+ (npm 11.5.1+) is used. See OIDC migration notes below.
#
# Note: This workflow uses no untrusted input in run commands.
