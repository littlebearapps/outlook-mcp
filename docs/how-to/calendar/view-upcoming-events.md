# How to View Upcoming Calendar Events

Check what's coming up on your calendar so your AI assistant can help with scheduling, preparation, or summarising your day.

## List Your Next Events

> "What's on my calendar this week?"

```
tool: list-events
```

With no parameters, this returns your next 10 upcoming events.

## See More Events

> "Show me my next 30 events"

```
tool: list-events
params:
  count: 30
```

Maximum is 50 events per request.

## What's Included in Each Event

Each event shows:

- **Subject** — meeting title
- **Start/End time** — in your configured timezone (default: Australia/Melbourne)
- **Location** — room or virtual meeting link
- **Attendees** — who's invited
- **Status** — accepted, tentative, declined
- **Online meeting URL** — Teams/Zoom link if applicable

## Tips

- `list-events` is read-only and auto-approved — no confirmation needed
- Events are sorted chronologically (soonest first)
- Ask your AI assistant to summarise your day: "What meetings do I have today?"
- Combine with email search: "Find any emails from people I'm meeting today"
