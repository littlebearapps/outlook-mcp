# How to Find Meeting Rooms

Search your organisation's meeting room directory to find available rooms by building, floor, or capacity.

## List All Rooms

> "Show me available meeting rooms"

```
tool: find-meeting-rooms
```

## Search by Building

> "Find rooms in the Melbourne HQ building"

```
tool: find-meeting-rooms
params:
  building: "Melbourne HQ"
```

## Filter by Minimum Capacity

> "Find a room that seats at least 10 people"

```
tool: find-meeting-rooms
params:
  capacity: 10
```

## Filter by Floor

```
tool: find-meeting-rooms
params:
  building: "Melbourne HQ"
  floor: 3
```

## Search by Room Name

```
tool: find-meeting-rooms
params:
  query: "Boardroom"
```

## See Full Room Details

```
tool: find-meeting-rooms
params:
  building: "Melbourne HQ"
  outputVerbosity: "full"
```

Full details may include AV equipment, accessibility features, and display name.

## Required Permissions

This tool requires the `Place.Read.All` Microsoft Graph permission. Your Exchange administrator must also have configured room resources in your organisation's directory.

## Parameter Reference

| Parameter | What it does | Example |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| `query` | Search by room name or email | `"Boardroom"` |
| `building` | Filter by building name | `"Melbourne HQ"` |
| `floor` | Filter by floor number | `3` |
| `capacity` | Minimum seats required | `10` |
| `outputVerbosity` | `minimal`, `standard`, or `full` | `"full"` |

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Cause | Fix |
|---------|-------|-----|
| No results returned | Missing permission or no rooms configured | Add `Places.Read.All` permission; check with Exchange admin |
| "Forbidden" error | Permission not granted | Grant `Places.Read.All` in Azure Portal |

## Tips

- This tool is read-only and auto-approved
- Combine with `create-event` to book a room: find it, then use the room's email as a location
- Not all organisations have room resources configured — check with your IT admin
