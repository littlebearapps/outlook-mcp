# How to Send Email Safely

Compose and send emails through your AI assistant with built-in safety controls: dry-run preview, rate limiting, and an optional recipient allowlist.

## Preview Before Sending (Dry Run)

Always preview first to check the email looks right:

> "Draft an email to sarah@company.com about the project update — don't send it yet"

```
tool: send-email
params:
  to: "sarah@company.com"
  subject: "Project Alpha Update"
  body: "Hi Sarah,\n\nHere's the latest on Project Alpha..."
  dryRun: true
```

The dry run shows exactly what will be sent — recipients, subject, body — without actually sending. Review it, then ask your AI assistant to send.

## Send an Email

> "Send an email to sarah@company.com about the meeting tomorrow"

```
tool: send-email
params:
  to: "sarah@company.com"
  subject: "Meeting Tomorrow"
  body: "Hi Sarah,\n\nJust confirming our meeting tomorrow at 10am.\n\nCheers"
```

Because `send-email` is marked as destructive, your AI assistant will always ask for your confirmation before sending — even without dry run.

## Send to Multiple Recipients

Use commas to separate addresses:

```
tool: send-email
params:
  to: "sarah@company.com, james@company.com"
  cc: "manager@company.com"
  subject: "Team Update"
  body: "Hi team,\n\n..."
```

| Field | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `to` | Primary recipients |
| `cc` | Carbon copy — visible to all |
| `bcc` | Blind carbon copy — hidden from other recipients |

## Set Email Importance

```
tool: send-email
params:
  to: "team@company.com"
  subject: "Urgent: Server outage"
  body: "..."
  importance: "high"
```

Options: `normal` (default), `high`, `low`.

## Safety Controls

### Confirmation Prompt

Every send triggers a confirmation prompt in your AI assistant. You must explicitly approve before the email leaves your outbox. This is enforced by the MCP `destructiveHint` annotation — it cannot be bypassed.

### Rate Limiting

Set a per-session send limit to prevent runaway sends:

```
OUTLOOK_MAX_EMAILS_PER_SESSION=10
```

Add this to your MCP server environment variables. Once the limit is reached, further sends are blocked until the session restarts.

### Recipient Allowlist

Restrict who your AI assistant can send to:

```
OUTLOOK_ALLOWED_RECIPIENTS=company.com,partner.org
```

With this set, emails can only be sent to addresses ending in `@company.com` or `@partner.org`. Sends to any other domain are blocked.

### Save to Sent Items

By default, sent emails appear in your Sent Items folder. To suppress:

```
tool: send-email
params:
  to: "..."
  subject: "..."
  body: "..."
  saveToSentItems: false
```

## Parameter Reference

| Parameter | What it does | Default |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| `to` | Recipient addresses (comma-separated) | **(required)** |
| `subject` | Email subject line | **(required)** |
| `body` | Email body (plain text or HTML) | **(required)** |
| `cc` | CC addresses (comma-separated) | — |
| `bcc` | BCC addresses (comma-separated) | — |
| `importance` | `normal`, `high`, or `low` | `normal` |
| `dryRun` | Preview without sending | `false` |
| `saveToSentItems` | Save to Sent Items folder | `true` |

## Tips

- Always use `dryRun: true` for important emails to review before sending
- Set `OUTLOOK_MAX_EMAILS_PER_SESSION` to prevent accidental bulk sends
- Use `OUTLOOK_ALLOWED_RECIPIENTS` in shared or automated environments
- HTML is supported in the body — use it for formatted emails
