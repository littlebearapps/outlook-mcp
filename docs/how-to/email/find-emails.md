# How to Find Emails

Search and filter your emails to find exactly what you need. With no search terms, Outlook Assistant lists your most recent messages.

## List Recent Emails

Ask your AI assistant to show your latest emails:

> "Show me my recent emails"

```
tool: search-emails
```

With no parameters, this returns the 25 most recent emails from your inbox.

## Search by Sender

> "Find emails from sarah@company.com"

```
tool: search-emails
params:
  from: "sarah@company.com"
```

You can also search by partial name:

```
tool: search-emails
params:
  from: "Sarah"
```

## Search by Subject

> "Find emails about the quarterly report"

```
tool: search-emails
params:
  subject: "quarterly report"
```

The `subject` parameter uses an OData filter (`contains(subject, ...)`) which works reliably on both personal and work/school accounts.

## Search by Keywords

> "Search my emails for budget approval"

```
tool: search-emails
params:
  query: "budget approval"
```

The `query` parameter searches across subject, body, and other fields.

> **Personal accounts**: Free-text `query` search uses Microsoft's `$search` API, which has limited support on personal Outlook.com accounts. Outlook Assistant handles this automatically — if `$search` returns no results, it progressively falls back to OData filters (`from`, `subject`, `to`), then boolean filters, then recent message listing. For the most direct results on personal accounts, use the structured filter parameters below. See [Account Compatibility](../../../README.md#account-compatibility) for details.

## Filter by Date Range

> "Show me emails from January 2026"

```
tool: search-emails
params:
  receivedAfter: "2026-01-01"
  receivedBefore: "2026-02-01"
```

Dates use ISO 8601 format (`YYYY-MM-DD` or full `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ`).

## Find Unread Emails Only

> "Show me my unread emails"

```
tool: search-emails
params:
  unreadOnly: true
```

## Find Emails with Attachments

> "Find emails with attachments from this month"

```
tool: search-emails
params:
  hasAttachments: true
  receivedAfter: "2026-03-01"
```

## Search a Specific Folder

By default, searches look in the inbox. To search another folder:

> "Show me my sent emails to john@company.com"

```
tool: search-emails
params:
  folder: "sentitems"
  to: "john@company.com"
```

Common folder names: `inbox`, `sentitems`, `drafts`, `deleteditems`, `archive`, `junkemail`.

You can also search custom folders by display name:

```
tool: search-emails
params:
  folder: "Projects/Client A"
  subject: "proposal"
```

### Searching Sent Items

When searching Sent Items, use `to:` to filter by recipient (since you are the sender of all emails in Sent Items):

```
tool: search-emails
params:
  folder: "sentitems"
  to: "client@example.com"
```

Other useful filters for Sent Items:

```
tool: search-emails
params:
  folder: "sentitems"
  subject: "invoice"
  receivedAfter: "2026-01-01"
  hasAttachments: true
```

> **Personal accounts**: Free-text `query` searches use Microsoft's `$search` API, which has limited support on personal Outlook.com accounts. Use structured filters (`to`, `subject`, `receivedAfter`, `hasAttachments`) for the most reliable results in any folder. These use `$filter` which works consistently across both personal and work accounts.

## Search Across All Folders

> "Search all my folders for the contract document"

```
tool: search-emails
params:
  query: "contract document"
  searchAllFolders: true
```

## Combine Filters

Filters stack — use multiple parameters together:

> "Find unread emails from Sarah with attachments received this week"

```
tool: search-emails
params:
  from: "Sarah"
  unreadOnly: true
  hasAttachments: true
  receivedAfter: "2026-02-24"
```

## Control the Number of Results

```
tool: search-emails
params:
  count: 10
```

| Mode | Default count | Maximum |
|------|--------------|---------|
| List (no query) | 25 | 50 |
| Search | 10 | 50 |

## Track Inbox Changes (Delta Sync)

Monitor your inbox for new, modified, or deleted emails since your last check:

> "Check for new emails since my last sync"

```
tool: search-emails
params:
  deltaMode: true
```

On the first call, this returns current emails and a `deltaToken`. Pass that token on subsequent calls to get only changes:

```
tool: search-emails
params:
  deltaMode: true
  deltaToken: "previous-token-here"
```

Delta sync is useful for inbox monitoring workflows, audit trails, and notification triggers. See [Monitor Your Inbox with Delta Sync](../ai-agents/monitor-inbox-with-delta-sync.md) for agent integration patterns.

## Parameter Reference

| Parameter | What it does | Example |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| `query` | Free-text search across all fields | `"budget approval"` |
| `from` | Filter by sender email or name | `"sarah@company.com"` |
| `to` | Filter by recipient | `"team@company.com"` |
| `subject` | Filter by subject line | `"quarterly report"` |
| `folder` | Which folder to search | `"sentitems"` |
| `unreadOnly` | Only unread messages | `true` |
| `hasAttachments` | Only messages with attachments | `true` |
| `receivedAfter` | Received after this date (ISO 8601) | `"2026-01-01"` |
| `receivedBefore` | Received before this date | `"2026-02-01"` |
| `searchAllFolders` | Search every folder | `true` |
| `count` | Number of results to return | `10` |
| `kqlQuery` | Raw KQL for advanced queries | `"from:ceo AND hasAttachment:true"` |
| `outputVerbosity` | Detail level: minimal, standard, full | `"minimal"` |

## Tips

- No query parameters = list mode (most recent emails first)
- Use `outputVerbosity: "minimal"` when you just need subject lines and dates
- For advanced queries, see the [KQL Search Reference](../advanced/kql-search-reference.md)
- Combine `from` + `receivedAfter` for the most targeted searches
- **Personal accounts (Outlook.com)**: Outlook Assistant automatically tries multiple search strategies if `$search` is unavailable, but `subject`, `from`, `to`, and date range filters give the most direct results. See [Account Compatibility](../../../README.md#account-compatibility)
