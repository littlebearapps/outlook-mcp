# How to Use Outlook Assistant in AI Agents

This guide helps AI agents and their developers make effective use of Outlook Assistant's 21 tools. It covers tool selection, safety annotations, output handling, and token efficiency.

## Tool Selection Guide

| User intent | Tool | Key parameters |
|-------------|------|---------------|
| Find/search/list emails | `search-emails` | `query`, `from`, `subject`, `folder` |
| Read email content | `read-email` | `id`, `outputVerbosity` |
| Send an email | `send-email` | `to`, `subject`, `body`, `dryRun` |
| Mark read/unread, flag | `update-email` | `action`, `id` or `ids` |
| List/download attachments | `attachments` | `messageId`, `action` |
| Export emails to files | `export` | `target`, `format`, `outputDir` |
| List calendar events | `list-events` | `count` |
| Create calendar event | `create-event` | `subject`, `start`, `end` |
| Decline/cancel/delete event | `manage-event` | `action`, `eventId` |
| Manage mail folders | `folders` | `action` |
| Manage inbox rules | `manage-rules` | `action` |
| Find people | `search-people` | `query` |
| Manage contacts | `manage-contact` | `action` |
| Manage categories | `manage-category` | `action` |
| Apply categories to emails | `apply-category` | `categories`, `messageId`/`messageIds` |
| Focused Inbox overrides | `manage-focused-inbox` | `action` |
| Out-of-office / working hours | `mailbox-settings` | `action` |
| Read shared mailbox | `access-shared-mailbox` | `sharedMailbox` |
| Find meeting rooms | `find-meeting-rooms` | `building`, `capacity` |
| Auth status/connect | `auth` | `action` |

## Safety Annotations

Every tool includes MCP annotations that indicate its safety profile:

| Annotation | Meaning | Effect in MCP clients |
|------------|---------|----------------------|
| `readOnlyHint: true` | No side effects | Auto-approved (in clients that support it) |
| `destructiveHint: true` | Can cause irreversible changes | Requires user confirmation |
| `idempotentHint: true` | Safe to retry | No special handling |
| `openWorldHint: true` | Communicates externally | Requires user confirmation |

### Read-Only Tools (auto-approved)

`search-emails`, `read-email`, `list-events`, `search-people`, `access-shared-mailbox`, `find-meeting-rooms`

### Destructive Tools (always require confirmation)

`send-email` (destructive + openWorld), `manage-event` (destructive)

### Other Tools

All remaining tools are non-destructive, non-read-only operations that respect the user's permission settings.

## Token Efficiency

Use `outputVerbosity: "minimal"` when you don't need full content:

```
tool: search-emails
params:
  from: "boss@company.com"
  outputVerbosity: "minimal"
```

This returns only subject, sender, and date — significantly reducing token usage for large result sets.

| Level | Tokens per email (approx.) | Use when |
|-------|---------------------------|----------|
| `minimal` | ~50 | Scanning, counting, listing |
| `standard` | ~200 | Reading previews, making decisions |
| `full` | ~500+ | Reading full content, analysis |

## Error Handling

Common error patterns:

| Error | Cause | Recovery |
|-------|-------|----------|
| 401 Unauthorized | Token expired | Call `auth` with `action: authenticate` |
| 403 Forbidden | Missing permission | Check required Graph API permissions |
| 404 Not Found | Invalid ID | Re-search for the item |
| 429 Too Many Requests | Rate limited | Wait and retry |
| Rate limit exceeded | `OUTLOOK_MAX_EMAILS_PER_SESSION` hit | Inform user, cannot send more |

## Common Agent Workflows

### Search and Summarise

1. `search-emails` with filters → get email IDs
2. `read-email` for each ID → get content
3. Summarise in natural language

### Find and Flag

1. `search-emails` with criteria → get IDs
2. `update-email` with `action: "flag"` and `ids: [...]` → batch flag

### Export a Thread

1. `search-emails` with `groupByConversation: true` → find thread
2. `export` with `target: "conversation"` → save to disk

### Check Before Scheduling

1. `list-events` → see existing calendar
2. `create-event` → schedule avoiding conflicts

### Monitor Inbox with Delta Sync

1. `search-emails` with `deltaMode: true` (no token) → initial sync + deltaToken
2. Store the deltaToken
3. On next check: `search-emails` with `deltaMode: true` and `deltaToken` → only changes
4. Process new/modified emails, note deleted IDs
5. Store new deltaToken for next iteration

Delta tokens expire after extended periods. If you receive a 410 error, start a fresh initial sync.

Use cases: inbox monitoring agents, audit trail logging, notification triggers, change tracking dashboards.

See [Monitor Your Inbox with Delta Sync](monitor-inbox-with-delta-sync.md) for a complete walkthrough.

### Automated Phishing Detection

1. `search-emails` with filters → find suspicious messages
2. `read-email` with `headersMode: true, importantOnly: true` → DKIM, SPF, DMARC results
3. Analyse authentication results and spam scores
4. `update-email` to flag or `apply-category` to tag suspicious messages
5. `folders` with `action: "move"` to quarantine folder

See [Investigate Email Headers](../advanced/investigate-email-headers.md) for header interpretation.

## Tips

- Always check `auth` status before multi-step workflows
- Use `dryRun: true` on `send-email` in automated contexts for human review
- Prefer `search-people` over `manage-contact` search — it searches more broadly
- Use `kqlQuery` for complex boolean searches, standard params for simple filters
- Batch operations (`ids`, `messageIds`, `emailIds`) reduce API calls
