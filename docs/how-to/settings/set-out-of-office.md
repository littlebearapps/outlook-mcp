# How to Set an Out-of-Office Reply

Enable automatic replies so people know you're away. Set separate messages for colleagues and external contacts, and schedule replies for specific dates.

## Enable an Immediate Out-of-Office

> "Turn on my out-of-office reply"

```
tool: mailbox-settings
params:
  action: "set-auto-replies"
  enabled: true
  internalReplyMessage: "I'm currently out of the office and will respond when I return."
```

This turns on auto-replies immediately and keeps them on until you disable them.

## Schedule Auto-Replies for Specific Dates

> "Set my out-of-office from March 10 to March 15"

```
tool: mailbox-settings
params:
  action: "set-auto-replies"
  enabled: true
  startDateTime: "2026-03-10T00:00:00Z"
  endDateTime: "2026-03-15T23:59:59Z"
  internalReplyMessage: "I'm on leave from 10–15 March. Back Monday 16th."
```

Scheduled mode automatically activates and deactivates at the specified times.

## Set Separate Messages for Internal and External Senders

> "Set different out-of-office messages for internal and external people"

```
tool: mailbox-settings
params:
  action: "set-auto-replies"
  enabled: true
  startDateTime: "2026-03-10T00:00:00Z"
  endDateTime: "2026-03-15T23:59:59Z"
  internalReplyMessage: "On leave. For urgent issues, contact James (james@company.com)."
  externalReplyMessage: "Thank you for your email. I'm currently out of the office and will respond after 15 March."
  externalAudience: "all"
```

## Control Who Gets the External Reply

| `externalAudience` | Who receives the external message |
|--------------------|----------------------------------|
| `none` | Nobody outside your organisation |
| `contactsOnly` | Only people in your contacts |
| `all` | Everyone outside your organisation |

If you omit `externalAudience`, the existing setting is preserved. If no external message is set, external senders receive no auto-reply.

## Disable Auto-Replies

> "Turn off my out-of-office"

```
tool: mailbox-settings
params:
  action: "set-auto-replies"
  enabled: false
```

## Check Current Auto-Reply Status

> "What's my current out-of-office status?"

```
tool: mailbox-settings
params:
  action: "get"
  section: "automaticRepliesSetting"
```

This shows whether auto-replies are enabled, the schedule, and the current messages.

## Parameter Reference

| Parameter | What it does | Example |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| `action` | Must be `set-auto-replies` | `"set-auto-replies"` |
| `enabled` | Turn on (`true`) or off (`false`) | `true` |
| `startDateTime` | When auto-replies activate (ISO 8601) | `"2026-03-10T00:00:00Z"` |
| `endDateTime` | When auto-replies stop (ISO 8601) | `"2026-03-15T23:59:59Z"` |
| `internalReplyMessage` | Message for people in your organisation | `"On leave until Monday."` |
| `externalReplyMessage` | Message for people outside your organisation | `"Out of office until 15 March."` |
| `externalAudience` | Who gets the external reply: `none`, `contactsOnly`, `all` | `"all"` |

## Tips

- Omit `startDateTime` and `endDateTime` to enable immediately (always-on mode)
- Include `startDateTime` and `endDateTime` for scheduled auto-activate/deactivate
- You can include HTML in your reply messages for formatting
- Check your current status with `action: "get"` before making changes
- If you enable auto-replies without providing a message, the server warns you — it will note if a previously configured message will be reused, or warn that recipients will receive a blank reply
